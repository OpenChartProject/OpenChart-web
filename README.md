OpenChart is a free, open source, web-based tool for creating rhythm game charts and maps. OpenChart is currently in active development.

We plan to add support for the following games:

- [Etterna](https://etternaonline.com/) / [Stepmania](https://www.stepmania.com/)
- [Quaver](https://quavergame.com/)
- [Osu! (mania)](https://osu.ppy.sh/)

You can view the editor here: http://openchart.io/

# Motivation

The primary goal for OpenChart is to create an editor which is:

1. Easy to use
2. Open source
3. Available for all platforms
4. Supports several rhythm games
5. Supports n-key charting (4k, 6k, 7k, etc.)

There are several other bullet points that could be added but it really just boils down to this: Provide the community with a transparent, accessible editor that makes it easy to share charts/maps between games.
